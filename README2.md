<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This fullstack project is prepared by 7 students of [HackYourFuture-Belgium](https://hackyourfuture.be/) as a graduation project.

The aim of the project is to help a parent who has recently moved to Belgium and looking for a secondary school for his/her child. The parent can get information about the secondary education in Belgium, search schools according to address, filter schools with various filters, can read comments and see important information about the schools. In addition to that, if the person chooses to sign in, s/he can save schools in his personal account, write comments and give ratings to the schools. The app also gives a school manager opportunity to add his/her school in our database.
